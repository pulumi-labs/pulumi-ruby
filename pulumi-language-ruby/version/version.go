// Package version carries the language host's version.
//
// The name shadows the standard library's go/version, which revive objects to. Every
// Pulumi language host calls this package `version`, and matching them is worth more than
// avoiding the shadow.
package version

// Version is initialized by the Go linker to contain the semver of this build.
//
// It is empty in a plain `go build`, which is what an unreleased build should report. The
// Makefile and .goreleaser.yml both stamp it with -X <this package>.Version=<semver>; the
// symbol path in those flags has to match this package's import path exactly, because the
// linker silently ignores a -X it cannot resolve.
